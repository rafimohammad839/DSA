# Approach to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms

1. First thing first, relax yourself before starting to solve any
DSA problem. As they say, a calm mind yields productivity.
2. Read the problem statement and make sure NOT TO JUMP into the code
right away. Take as much time to understand the problem as you can, 15 minutes, 30 minutes or even 1 hour if you are a beginner. 
3. When you've understood it, you are supposed to plan the whole picture of solution in your mind and not jump into the code because
there are many many things to take into consideration when solving a problem. There are edge cases, strange test scenarios and many more things. Break the entire problem down into many sub-problems. For example: You wanna check if a number is a palindrome. The sub-problem would be "How to get each individual digit out of that number" and so on. If you cannot do it all in your head, then go ahead and do it on a paper or a notepad, but don't be tempted to write the code so fast.
4. When you've sorted that all out and found the solution, then try it on the code. Don't worry if the approach you have thought of is bruteforce. Just make it work anyhow. 
5. Once your bruteforce approach has finally worked, now try to come up with a better approach to optimize the code. Take into account time complexity and space complexity.
